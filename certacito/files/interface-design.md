# Interface Design - what changed since A3 and why

A4 appendix. A3 presented eight high-fidelity Figma screens. A4 is those screens
implemented as a working React app fed by the real API. This doc lists where the
implementation deviates from the A3 designs and the reason for each change.

## 1. What stayed the same

The A3 design system survived contact with implementation almost untouched:

- Colour system and its "one job per colour" rule (navy structure, teal active/permit,
  red critical/deny, green permit/pass, amber escalate).
- Persistent navy sidebar, breadcrumb header, card-on-grey layout.
- Unified risk/outcome badges - colour always paired with a text label (WCAG 2.1 AA,
  risk is never conveyed by colour alone).
- Screen set and the two persona journeys (Compliance Officer triage path,
  DevSecOps configuration path).
- Expandable row detail on the audit log and approval queue.

## 2. What changed, and why

| # | A3 design | A4 implementation | Why |
|---|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| 1 | Sign-in via Azure AD | Local JWT login (email + bcrypt password), SSO button kept as inactive placeholder | Azure subscription not provisioned yet (FR-07 staged on Proxmox). JWT + RBAC gives the same role-gated behaviour to demo; the SSO swap is isolated inside `auth.py`. |
| 2 | Typography: Inter / JetBrains Mono | Arial / Courier New system stack | Licensing-free system fonts render identically across marker machines with zero font loading. Visual intent (prose vs system identifiers) is preserved. Revisit for production. |
| 3 | Static mock numbers in every panel | All KPIs, feeds, charts and tables driven by the live API; WebSocket push for instant updates | The A3 prototype only had to look real. A4 has to be real - a live simulator (~4 events/min) plus the OpenClaw agent feed the same pipeline a customer deployment would. |
| 4 | Audit "Export modal" | Direct Export CSV (client-side) + Export PDF (print stylesheet) + a new **Verify chain** button | Verify chain surfaces the tamper-evidence story in one click during demos - it re-walks the whole SHA-256 chain server-side. The modal added a step without adding value. |
| 5 | No landing page in A3 | Public marketing landing page before login | Exhibition feedback: visitors need the "what is this and why should I care" story before the console. Also carries the group branding. |
| 6 | Audit detail drawer showed one exemplar record | Detail row renders the actual selected entry: masked payload, its own chain hash, previous-entry hash, real decision trail | Markers click more than one row. Mock detail on real rows read as broken. |
| 7 | Notifications area (bell) with static badge | Badge counts live pending approvals + criticals | Same reason as 3. |
| 8 | 2-second polling everywhere (A3 assumed it) | WebSocket-first, 10 s fallback poll | Polling three endpoints every 2 s tripped our own API rate limit after a minute on screen. The socket is instant and cheaper. |

## 3. Screens as implemented

Current screenshots live in `docs/screenshots/` (taken from the running system,
simulator on). Screen-by-screen purpose is unchanged from A3 section 3.3.

## 4. Sponsor/supervisor feedback applied

- "Interception-first framing" (Anthony, A3 review) - the dashboard leads with the
  live intercepted-actions feed, not agent inventory.
- "Understandable in a few minutes by someone new" (supervisor email, June) - the
  landing page + healthcare demo scenario (`POST /api/v1/demo/healthcare-scenario`)
  give a self-contained walkthrough.
