# System Functionality and Expected User Interaction

A4 appendix. What the system does today and how each kind of user is expected to
interact with it. FR numbers refer to the RTM (`docs/requirements-traceability.md`).

## 1. Actors

| Actor | How they touch the system |
|---|---|
| AI agent | Machine caller. POSTs intended actions to `/api/v1/intercept` with an `X-API-Key` before executing them, and obeys the PERMIT/DENY/ESCALATE answer. |
| Administrator | Full console access: policies, users, agents, approvals, reports. |
| Analyst | Reviews approvals, reads audit/reports, manages day-to-day governance. Cannot manage users or delete policies. |
| Viewer | Read-only visibility across dashboard, audit and reports. |

## 2. The core loop (FR-01..FR-06)

1. An agent wants to act (read a dataset, call an API, write files, send email...).
2. The hook/SDK intercepts the action pre-execution and sends it to Certacito.
3. Semantic guard (FR-08) checks content, risk classifier (FR-09) scores it,
   policy engine (FR-02) matches the rules.
4. **PERMIT** - agent proceeds. **DENY** - agent is blocked. **ESCALATE** (FR-05) -
   action pauses into the approval queue with an SLA countdown.
5. A human approves or denies from the queue; SLA expiry auto-rejects (fail-closed).
6. Every decision lands in the hash-chained audit log (FR-03) and appears on the
   dashboard within two seconds (FR-06) via WebSocket push.

## 3. Expected interaction, screen by screen

**Landing page** - public. Explains the product, "Log in" enters the console.

**Sign-in** - email + password (demo: `admin@certacito.ai` / `<ask Nico>`). Wrong
creds get a generic error; the login endpoint is rate-limited (10/min) against
brute force.

**Agent Overview** - first screen after login. Card per registered agent: status,
risk tier, compliance score, violation count. Scan-level view; "View in Registry"
jumps to management.

**Governance Dashboard** - the compliance officer's home. KPI tiles (intercepted,
blocked, critical, pending approvals), live activity feed (newest decisions push in
via the socket), risk breakdown, 7-day decision trend, top violated rules, quick
actions. Clicking a feed item or "View queue" deep-links to the relevant screen.

**Audit Log** - the evidence screen. Filter by search text, risk, outcome, action
type. Click a row to expand the full decision record: PII-masked payload, the
entry's SHA-256 chain hash and its predecessor's, and the decision trail. **Verify
chain** re-walks the whole chain server-side and reports intact/broken with the
entry count. Export CSV downloads the filtered view; Export PDF prints it.

**Approval Queue** - human-in-the-loop. Each pending item shows the agent, the
masked payload, the matched rule and a live SLA countdown ("until auto-reject").
Approve/Deny asks for confirmation, is logged permanently and attributes the
decision to the signed-in reviewer (from the JWT, not the request).

**Policy Rules** - DevSecOps home. Rule list with action-type filter chips.
Create/edit rules (name, action type, risk threshold, default outcome, conditions,
regulatory tag), toggle rules active/disabled (persists via the API), inspect
version history. A banner reminds that rules are version-controlled config, not
model prompts. Rule changes take effect on the next intercepted action.

**Agent Registry** - register agents, edit metadata (model, environment, owner),
suspend/reactivate instantly. Suspension causes the policy engine to DENY that
agent's actions.

**Reports & Compliance** - per-framework compliance scoring (Privacy Act 1988,
ISO 27001, SOC 2, OWASP LLM Top 10, NIST CSF, ASD Essential 8) computed from the
audit history, with week-on-week deltas.

**Settings** - user management (admin only): create users, assign roles.

## 4. Demo scenario (repeatable)

`POST /api/v1/demo/healthcare-scenario` replays a scripted GP-office sequence -
a permitted read, a denied out-of-scope Medicare record access, and an escalated
bulk export - so a full governance story can be told in ~2 minutes without waiting
for the simulator. This also stands in for the Group 2 integration (FR-11) until
their agent API contract lands.

## 5. What a user should NOT be able to do (and why we test it)

- A Viewer cannot approve, edit policies or create users (RBAC regression tests).
- Nobody can edit or delete an audit entry through the API - there is no endpoint.
- An agent key cannot call human endpoints, and a JWT-less browser gets 401s.
- Registration is closed: only admins create accounts (first account bootstraps).
