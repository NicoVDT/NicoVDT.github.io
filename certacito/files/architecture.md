# System Architecture

Certacito.ai is a governance layer that sits between an AI agent and the actions it
wants to take. Every tool call is intercepted before execution, evaluated against
policy that lives outside the model, and recorded in a tamper-evident log.

This describes what is actually built and deployed, not a target state.

## The layers

```

```

## Front end

React 18 with TypeScript, built by Vite 6.3. Tailwind CSS 4 for styling, Recharts
for the dashboard visualisations, Radix primitives underneath the component set
inherited from the A3 Figma work.

The SPA is a single bundle. `API_BASE` resolves to `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || ""`,
so in the deployed configuration the frontend calls the same origin it was served
from and needs no build-time API URL.

Live updates come over a WebSocket at `/api/v1/ws/live` rather than polling. The
socket authenticates with `?token=<jwt>`; an unauthenticated socket is rejected.
Polling exists only as a fallback if the socket cannot connect.

## Back end

FastAPI on Python 3.13, served by uvicorn. Fourteen routers mounted under
`/api/v1`: interception, audit, approval, policy, auth, stats, guardrails,
websocket, agents, demo, reports, dryrun, trends and API keys.

Two pieces of middleware sit in front of every request: CORS, and a rate limiter
allowing 60 requests/minute generally and 10/minute on auth endpoints. Behind a
reverse proxy the limiter keys off `X-Real-IP`, because without it every client
shares the proxy's bucket and one active dashboard locks everyone out.

Static files are mounted last, at `/`, so `/api/*` and `/health` keep winning
against the SPA catch-all.

### Interception path

`POST /api/v1/intercept` is the core of the system. Order of operations:

1. **Semantic guardrail runs first.** Regex pattern sets for prompt injection,
   jailbreak and exfiltration attempts, each carrying a hand-tuned confidence.
   A proximity-based discount suppresses the common false positive where text
   *discusses* injection rather than attempting it. If the guard blocks it
   short-circuits: outcome DENY, rule `SEMANTIC-GUARD`, risk Critical, and it
   still writes an audit entry. The policy engine never runs.
2. **Policy evaluation**, wrapped in try/except. Any exception becomes DENY at
   Critical risk.
3. **Approval item created** on ESCALATE only.
4. **Audit entry written for every outcome**, PERMIT included. No path through
   this endpoint skips the audit write.
5. **WebSocket broadcast** so connected dashboards update without polling.

### Fail-closed behaviour

Four independent points, all real:

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| No policy rule matches the action | DENY, risk Medium, "denied by default" |
| Policy engine raises | DENY, risk Critical |
| Policy YAML missing at startup | rules stay empty, so everything hits the no-match DENY |
| No valid API key or JWT | 401, request never reaches policy |

The system defaults to refusing rather than allowing.

### Policy engine

Rules load from `backend/policies.yaml` (12 rules) via the `POLICY_CONFIG` setting.
A further 10 pre-built rules ship in `rule_library.yaml` and can be imported into
the database through the API, which is what populates the Policy Rules screen.

Conditions are parsed, not keyword-matched. The parser handles `==`, `!=`, `>`,
`IN`, `NOT IN`, `MATCHES`, `NOT MATCHES` and `AND`, resolved against named sets
(`approved_tools`, `approved_vendors`, `approved_domains`, `restricted_tables`,
`restricted_datasets`) defined in the same file.

Where a condition cannot be resolved the rule **does not match**, and the request
falls through to the default deny. That direction is deliberate: unresolvable
conditions were previously treated as satisfied, which on a *permit* rule meant
allowing exactly the thing the rule existed to gate.

**Known limitation:** `OR` is not supported.

### Audit chain

Append-only and hash-chained. Each entry's hash is SHA-256 over a preimage built
from every stored column: `entry_id`, `timestamp`, `agent_id`, `action_type`,
`outcome`, `risk_level`, `policy_rule`, `policy_desc`, `session_id`,
`payload_masked`, a `payload_hash`, and the previous entry's hash. The preimage is
sorted JSON rather than concatenated strings, so two different entries cannot
produce the same one by shifting where a field ends. The chain starts from a fixed
genesis hash.

`payload_hash` is taken over the **raw** payload, before masking. That is
deliberate - the integrity check then covers what the agent actually sent, not the
redacted copy we display. The masked copy is covered separately as its own field.

Covering every column matters. The hash previously covered 7 of the 12 stored
fields, so `risk_level` or the masked payload could be rewritten without breaking
the chain: a Critical could be dropped to Low and verification still reported
valid. `GET /api/v1/audit/verify` now walks from genesis and recomputes each hash
rather than only comparing stored hashes to one another.

Appends are serialised behind an `asyncio.Lock`. This is not incidental: two
concurrent intercepts could previously both read the same chain head and both
append to it, forking the log. `GET /api/v1/audit/verify` re-walks the chain
server-side and recomputes every hash.

The guarantee is **tamper-evident, not tamper-proof.** Anyone with database access
can still delete rows. What they cannot do is delete them without breaking the
chain, and verification surfaces that. Append-only is enforced at application
level; there is no database trigger.

### Authentication and access control

JWT bearer tokens for users, bcrypt for password hashing (pinned to 4.0.1, because
passlib probes the backend with an over-length string that bcrypt 4.1+ raises on
rather than truncating, which broke every login on a clean install).

Three roles: Administrator, Analyst, Viewer. Every endpoint carries an auth
dependency; the role constants live in `backend/api/auth.py`. Agent-facing
endpoints accept either an `X-API-Key` or a JWT via the `agent_or_user` dependency,
because agents cannot perform the login flow.

Payloads are masked before storage. Masking covers top-level keys only, which is
recorded as a limitation.

## Data model

PostgreSQL 16, accessed asynchronously through SQLAlchemy 2.0 with asyncpg.
Alembic manages migrations. Seven tables: `audit_log`, `approval_queue`,
`policy_rules`, `users`, `api_keys`, `scheduled_reports`, `report_exports`.

Redis 7 backs rate limiting and transient state.

A background scheduler task starts with the application and drives scheduled
report generation.

## Deployment

**Production is Docker Compose on an Azure VM**, not a managed platform. Three
services from `docker-compose.azure.yml`:

- `postgres` (postgres:16-alpine) with a named volume
- `redis` (redis:7-alpine)
- `app`, built from `infra/docker/Dockerfile.azure`, published `80:8000`

The app image is a two-stage build. Stage one runs `npm ci` and `vite build`;
stage two installs the Python dependencies and copies the built frontend in as
`frontend_dist/`, which FastAPI serves. One image, one container, no nginx.

Configuration is entirely environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`,
`SECRET_KEY`, `AGENT_API_KEY`, `POLICY_CONFIG`, `RULE_LIBRARY`), read from a `.env`
that is not in the repository. That makes the secrets externalisable to a secret
manager without code changes.

Deployment is a pull-and-rebuild script on the VM, triggered over SSH by a GitHub
Actions workflow. The CI deploy key is pinned to a forced command in the VM's
`authorized_keys`, so it can run the deploy script and nothing else.

## Non-functional characteristics

| Concern | How it is addressed |
|---|---|
| Latency | WebSocket push rather than polling; sub-second dashboard updates |
| Integrity | SHA-256 hash-chained audit with server-side verification |
| Access control | JWT + bcrypt + RBAC on every endpoint |
| Confidentiality | PII masking on stored payloads (top-level keys) |
| Availability under load | Rate limiting, 60/min general and 10/min auth |
| Failure mode | Fail-closed at four independent points |

## Known gaps

Recorded here rather than only in the traceability matrix, because they are
architectural rather than feature-level:

- Policy conditions do not support `OR` (FR-02).
- Approval SLA expiry is evaluated lazily on read; there is no background expiry
  worker (FR-05).
- PII masking covers top-level payload keys only.
- Audit append-only is enforced in the application, not by a database constraint.
- CORS origins are still the development list.
